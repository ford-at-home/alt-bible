**Verse 1:**  
Boom! The universe just *detonated* into existence, bro—like God hit the cosmic “Fight Island” button. Heaven? Earth? Dude just flexed creation out of *nothing*. Imagine the Big Bang as a galactic UFC punch, and God’s the heavyweight champ spittin’ stars into the void. Jamie, pull up that ancient alien megastructure diagram—this is some DMT-level architecture!  

**Verse 2:**  
Earth’s a total hot mess—no shape, all darkness, like a post-apocalyptic LA riverbed. God’s Spirit? It’s *hovering* over the waters, man—like a celestial UFO doing recon. You ever seen that on shrooms? Swirling void chaos, and then… *something* tuning in. Guest Comment: “Bro, that’s the OG fractal!”  

**Verse 3:**  
God drops the mic: “Let there be LIGHT!”—and *BAM*, reality’s first rave starts blasting. No sun yet, just pure divine glow, like Tesla coils on steroids. Jamie, pull up the Ark of the Covenant—what if that’s ancient alien tech? Dude just spoke photons into existence. *Mind. Blown.*
