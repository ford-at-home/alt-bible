Verse 1:  
In the motherf***in’ beginning, God Almighty flexed—BAM!—crafted the skies, slammed down the earth. No debate. No committee. Just divine hands gettin’ *busy*.  

Verse 2:  
Earth? Was a hot mess. Empty, chaotic, darker than a snake’s belly. Deep waters? Pitch-black abyss. But God’s Spirit? Oh, He was *prowlin’* over that chaos like, “Y’all ain’t ready for what’s comin’.”  

Verse 3:  
Then God ain’t playin’—He barked, “LIGHT—GET YOUR ASS OUT HERE!” And light? *Obliged*. Split the darkness like a goddamn lightsaber. Boom. Day one. Mic drop.
