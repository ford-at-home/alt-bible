    "1": "Alright, check this out—so God just *blasts* into existence, right? Creates the heavens and Earth like it’s nothing. Boom! Cosmic big bang energy, man. Wild.",
    "2": "Earth’s a total mess at first—dark, formless, like primordial soup. But the Spirit’s hovering over the waters, vibing, like it’s about to drop the ultimate mixtape.",
    "3": "God goes, ‘Yo, LIGHT!’ And bam—photon fireworks everywhere. Dude just spoke it into existence. No big deal. Ever tried DMT? This is that level of wild.",
    "4": "He’s like, ‘Light’s dope, dark’s chill—let’s split ‘em up.’ Creates day and night. First divine algorithm. Five stars, would recommend.",
    "5": "Calls light ‘Day,’ dark ‘Night.’ Sunset to sunrise—day one in the books. Mic drop.",
    "6": "Next up, God’s like, ‘Let’s build a dome in the sky—separate the waters above and below.’ Cosmic waterbed situation. Genius engineering.",
    "7": "So He crafts this massive atmospheric barrier. Waters under the dome, waters above it. Physics? Nah, divine architecture.",
    "8": "Names the dome ‘Heaven.’ Sky’s the limit now. Day two—*chef’s kiss*.",
    "9": "Day three: ‘Gather the oceans, let dry land pop up.’ Earth does a continental split. Pangea’s first draft. Solid move.",
    "10": "Calls land ‘Earth,’ waters ‘Seas.’ God nods—‘This slaps.’",
    "11": "Then He’s like, ‘Earth, grow plants! Grass, fruit trees, the whole salad bar.’ Photosynthesis kicks in. Green revolution, baby.",
    "12": "Earth goes full permaculture—seed-bearing plants everywhere. God’s stoked. ‘Certified organic,’ He mutters.",
    "13": "Sunset. Sunrise. Day three done. Three-day creative sprint—no burnout.",
    "14": "Day four: ‘Let’s hang some bling in the sky—sun, moon, stars. Seasons, zodiac signs, TikTok horoscopes—all you nerds eat this up.’",
    "15": "Lights installed. Earth’s got a nightlight and a tanning bed. Functional *and* aesthetic.",
    "16": "Big sun for day shifts, mood-lighting moon for nights. Stars? Just flexing. Galaxy brain move.",
    "17": "God positions ‘em all. ‘There—now Earth’s got ambiance.’",
    "18": "Day/night cycle locked in. God approves. ‘Vibes immaculate.’",
    "19": "Sunset. Sunrise. Day four—stellar.",
    "20": "Day five: ‘Oceans, swarm with life! Birds, go nuts in the sky.’ Suddenly, whales breach, sharks prowl, eagles soar. Planet’s lit now.",
    "21": "Creates sea monsters—leviathans, kraken prototypes. Birds? Feathery acrobats. God grins. ‘Metal.’",
    "22": "Blesses them: ‘Go multiply! Fill those oceans, skies. Make David Attenborough proud.’",
    "23": "Sunset. Sunrise. Day five—ocean’s lit, air traffic’s busy.",
    "24": "Day six: ‘Earth, birth some land beasts—cattle, critters, all the safari stuff.’ Lions, tigers, bears—oh my. Biodiversity unlocked.",
    "25": "Creates every species. God high-fives Himself. ‘Ecosystem’s balanced. Dope.’",
    "26": "Then—plot twist—‘Let’s make humans. Our image. Mini-mes to run this zoo. They’ll dominate fish, birds, beasts. Hope they don’t wreck it.’",
    "27": "So He crafts Adam and Eve—gender-fluid icons. Divine selfies. ‘Apes, but make it fashion.’",
    "28": "Blesses them: ‘Go forth, multiply, Netflix and chill—but responsibly. Rule Earth, but don’t be tyrants.’",
    "29": "Assigns vegan diets: ‘Plants, seeds, fruit—all-you-can-eat salad bar. No keto yet.’",
    "30": "Tells animals, ‘You’re herbivores too. No predation—yet. Keep it PG.’",
    "31": "God surveys His work—pristine Earth, thriving life. ‘Nailed it. Six days. Rest? Oh yeah.’ Sunset. Sunrise. Mic drop."
